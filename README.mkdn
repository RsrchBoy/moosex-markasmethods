# NAME

MooseX::MarkAsMethods - Mark overload code symbols as methods

# SYNOPSIS

    package Foo;
    use Moose;

    # mark overloads as methods and wipe other non-methods
    use MooseX::MarkAsMethods autoclean => 1;

    # ...

    package Bar;
    use Moose;

    # order is important!
    use namespace::autoclean;
    use MooseX::MarkAsMethods;

    # ...

# DESCRIPTION

MooseX::MarkAsMethods allows one to easily mark certain functions as Moose
methods.  This will allow other packages such as namespace::autoclean to
operate without, say, blowing away your overloads.

By default we check for overloads, and mark those functions as methods.

If 'autoclean => 1' is passed to import on use'ing this module, we will clean
out all non-methods in the same fashion namespace::autoclean does, except
without the ability to specify additional non-methods to nuke.

# CAVEAT

As currently implemented, we run our "method maker" at the end of the calling
package's compile scope ([B::Hooks::EndOfScope](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?B::Hooks::EndOfScope)).  As [namespace::autoclean](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?namespace::autoclean)
does the same thing, it's important that if namespace::autoclean is used that
it be use'd BEFORE MooseX::MarkAsMethods, so that its end_of_scope block is
run after ours.

The easiest way to invoke this module and clean out non-methods without having
to worry about ordering is:

    use MooseX::MarkAsMethods autoclean => 1;
